# Solution:
1. Initialize first row [[1]] of pascal Triangle & if n=1 return array.
2. Else, Intialize Second row array becomes [[1],[1,1]]. (also if n==2 return array before entering loop)
3. To compute other rows, we know 1st and last element of each row is 1 
4. And, every element corresponds to sum of previous row's adjacent elements.
5. We need to consider the integer overflow, so % 10**7.
